Better Snipmate Snippets for VIM
========================

Short info...
-------------

This repository is kind of hybrid of [snipmate.vim](https://github.com/msanders/snipmate.vim) and [snipmate-snippets](https://github.com/scrooloose/snipmate-snippets).

Installation
------------

I recommend installing [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen), and
then simply copy and paste:

    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone git://github.com/bartekd/better-snipmate-snippets.git
